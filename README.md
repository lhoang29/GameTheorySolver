This is a solver for different types of games from Game Theory. 
Currently it can solve some specific classes of zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.
Games where every player has more than 2 strategies are not currently solvable, however
the project is designed for flexibility and extensibility. In the source code listing,
there should be a UML drawing design for the structure of the framework called "Framework Design.jpg". The application
also visualizes flow diagram and envelope solutions using OpenGL. Both 2D and 3D visualizations
are possible.
